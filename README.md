# lilengine

lilengine is a game engine written from scratch in C++. lilengine utilizes various APIs to write sprites to a defined window, process keyboard inputs, play sounds, manage game objects via an Entity Component System (ECS), and run user-written Lua scripts. I have created two executable game demos, one of the classic game pong, and a barebones farming game.
